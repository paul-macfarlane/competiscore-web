# TODOs.md

List of miscellaneous TODOs for the project.

Move items to the appropriate section as they are completed. Testing should be done by a human before moving to the "Done" section.

## Ice box

- Need to get branding approved by google
- Icons should be more light/dark mode friendly and avoid super bright or dark colors.
- Validate existing code quality for consistency, security issues, avoiding duplication, following standards in CLAUDE.md inconsistent business logic with what is in product vision doc, and unused code.
- Lists of items that could eventually grow large should all be pagingated. Right now, we are not paginating the following but should eventually be
  - Challenges (received, sent)
  - Tournaments on tournament page, both active and completed
  - Members and placeholder members on members page
  - Teams
  - All the different tabs of reports pagehe
- For the sake of consistency, tournaments should probably also have icons available for them
- On the mobile view, the competiscore icon and logo are not centered in the header. Lets fix that.
