# TODOs.md

List of miscellaneous TODOs for the project.

Move items to the appropriate section as they are completed. Testing should be done by a human before moving to the "Done" section.

## Ice box

- Need to get branding approved by google
- Validate existing code quality for consistency, security issues, avoiding duplication, following standards in CLAUDE.md inconsistent business logic with what is in product vision doc, and unused code.
- There is some minor inconsistencies in the UI between lists and cards of cards. I need to do a deeper look and see if there is any improvements that can be made.
- The "command" component does not scroll on mobile. Needs a deep investigation to see if we can fix it somehow.
