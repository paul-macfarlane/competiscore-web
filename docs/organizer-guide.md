# Competiscore Organizer Guide

## Getting Started

1. Open the invite link you were sent — it will take you to a join page
2. Sign in with Discord or Google, then click **Join**
3. You'll land on the event home page where you can see team standings and recent activity

## Navigating the App

The top tabs are your main navigation:

- **Home** — Team standings chart and recent scoring activity
- **Activity** — Matches, Best Scores, and Tournaments
- **People** — Participants and Teams
- **Manage** — Game Types and Settings (organizer-only)

## Running a Tournament

### Adding Participants

1. Go to **Activity > Tournaments** and open your tournament
2. While the tournament is in **Draft** status, use the participant dropdown to add players
3. If using manual seeding, enter seed numbers and click **Save Seeds**
4. When everyone is added, click **Generate Bracket** — this starts the tournament

### Recording Match Results

1. On your tournament page, find the pending match
2. Click **Record Result**
3. Enter scores or select the winner (depending on the game type)
4. Submit — the bracket updates automatically

For **Swiss tournaments**, the next round is generated automatically once all current-round matches are recorded. For **single elimination**, losers are eliminated and the bracket advances.

### Forfeits

If a participant no-shows, click the **Forfeit** option on their match to advance their opponent.

## Recording Best Scores (Qualifiers)

For qualifying events like Bouncing Balls Qualifiers:

1. Go to **Activity > Best Scores**
2. Open the session (or create one via **Open Session** if needed)
3. Participants submit their own scores, or you can record them
4. When qualifying is done, click **Close Session** to lock scores and award placement points

### Pair/Group Qualifiers

If the game type was set up with **Players per Entry > 1** (e.g., a 2-player relay), score submission works slightly differently:

1. Open the session as normal
2. When submitting a score, you'll see multiple **Member** dropdowns instead of a single participant selector
3. Select each member of the group — only players on the **same team** can be paired together
4. The second member's dropdown will automatically filter to teammates of the first member
5. Submit the shared score — the group appears on the leaderboard as "Name1 & Name2"
6. Close the session as normal — placement points are credited to the shared team, and each member is individually recorded for analytics

## Recording Standalone Matches

For matches outside of a tournament:

1. Go to **Activity > Matches > Record Match**
2. Select the game type
3. Choose participants for each side
4. Enter the result and submit

## Tips

- You can only add participants to a tournament while it's in **Draft** status — once the bracket is generated, the roster is locked
- Swiss tournaments pair players by record each round and handle byes automatically for odd numbers
- Placement points (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.) are awarded to teams when a tournament completes
- For pair/group qualifiers, the second member dropdown only shows teammates of the first member — make sure all players are assigned to teams before opening the session
